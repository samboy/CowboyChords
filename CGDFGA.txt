After running the Cowboy Chord finder against a huge number of tunings,
I found a really intersting tuning:

* This is the same tuning as a tenor guitar (CGDA), but with two notes
  added between the third and forth string, making it CGDFGA

* Standard EADGBE tuning only allows one I-V-vi-IV progression with just
  "Cowboy Chords".  This tuning has three different possible "Cowboy Chord"
  I-V-vi-IV progressions.

* Standard tuning has five major "Cowboy Chords" and three minor "Cowboy 
  Chords".  This tuning has six major easy-to-strum chords and five minor
  easily strummed open chords.

* Most of a minor penatonic scale can be played by simply playing the
  four highest open notes (DFGA); one then holds the third fret (or plays
  the low string, if octave transitions are OK) on the high string to
  finsh the minor penatonic scale.

* A lot of the chords double the notes in unison, giving it a distinctly
  different tone than the traditional guitar tuning.

Score: [6, 5, 4, 3] Tuning: E B F# A B C# (or CGDFGA or GDACDE)
Possible "Cowboy Chords" (when the low note is E):

Major: E F# G A B D 
Minor: Em F#m G#m Am Bm 
Maj7:  E7 G7 B7 D7 
Min7:  Em7 F#m7 Bm7 

So, we have 11 "Cowboy Chords" as opposed to EADGBE's eight.  The fingering
here is from low pitched string to high pitched string; 'X' means to not
strum that string in the chord; the number is the fret held down (0 for
open string):

A    ['X', 'X', 3, 0, 2, 3]  - - A A C# E
Am   ['X', 'X', 3, 0, 1, 3]  - - A A C E

B    ['X', 0, 0, 2, 0, 2]    - B F# B B D#
B7   ['X', 0, 0, 1, 0, 2]    - B F# A# B D#
Bm   ['X', 0, 0, 2, 0, 1]    - B F# B B D
Bm   ['X', 0, 0, 2, 3, 1]    - B F# B D D
Bm7  ['X', 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]    - B F# A B D
Bm7  ['X', 0, 0, 0, 3, 1]    - B F# A D D

D    ['X', 3, 0, 0, 3, 1]    - D F# A D D
D7   ['X', 3, 0, 0, 2, 0]    - D F# A C# C#
D7   ['X', 3, 0, 0, 2, 1]    - D F# A C# D
D7   ['X', 3, 0, 0, 3, 0]    - D F# A D C#

E    [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3]      E B G# B B E
E7   [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2]      E B G# B B D#
Em   [0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 3]      E B G B B E
Em7  [0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1]      E B G B B D

F#   ['X', 'X', 0, 1, 2, 0]  - - F# A# C# C#
F#m  ['X', 'X', 0, 0, 2, 0]  - - F# A C# C#
F#m  [2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0]      F# C# F# A C# C#
F#m7 ['X', 'X', 0, 0, 2, 3]  - - F# A C# E

G    ['X', 'X', 1, 2, 0, 1]  - - G B B D
G7   [3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1]      G B F# B B D

G#m  ['X', 'X', 2, 2, 0, 2]  - - G# B B D#

A number of Major I-IV-V progressions are possible:

E-A-B
A-D-E
B-E-F#
D-G-A

There is even some I-V-vi-IV progrssions there:

A-E-f#m-D
B-F#-g#m-E
D-A-Bmin-G

A couple of minor i-iv-v progressions:

e-a-b
b-e-f#

Playing the F# minor penatonic scale (which goes with a A-E-f#m-D progression)
is easy: 

http://jguitar.com/scale?root=F%23&scale=Minor+Pentatonic&tuning=4E%2C4B%2C5F%23%2C5A%2C5B%2C6C%23&fret=0&labels=none&notes=sharps

The first four notes are the open F#-A-B-C# strings, then the third fret
of the high string is the "E" at the top of the F# minor penatonic scale.

The tuning, however, is quirky:

* We go up a perfect fifth twice
* We then go up a minor third
* We finally go up a whole step twice

As an aside, EADGBE has only one usable I-V-vi-IV progression with 
just Cowboy Chords:

G-D-e-C (the chords fingered in my favorite tool, the ChordBuddy)
