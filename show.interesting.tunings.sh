# of different tunings, and looks for tunings with a lot of major I-IV-V
# chord progressions using only Cowboy Chords (only first three frets used,
# only three prets pushed at a given time).

# Note that while 'delete array' for deleting an entire array has not been
# part of the POSIX spec, pretty much every implementation of AWK out there
# (GAWK, BWK AWK, Busybox AWK, etc.) supports it, and it has been accepted as
# being part of the next version of POSIX:
